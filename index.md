## 10-31-2020 FuryBSD has been discontinued

Thank you for your interest in FuryBSD.  If you have installed using the live media you can continue to updating using traditional FreeBSD update mechanisms.  There is no need for a migration.  If you enjoyed using the LiveCD please see projects such as [GhostBSD](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) [FyneDesk](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) [HelloSystem](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) [LIVEStep](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).  

Some reasons for the decision to continue this effort include:

* Recent hacking/hijacking of community telegram, forums, website (the administration overhead required to maintain these resources is to much for one person).
