# 10-31-2020 FuryBSD has been discontinued

Thank you for your interest in FuryBSD.  Due to administrative overhead, time, lack of resources this project has been discontinued as an effort to build, and publish quarterly ISO images.  

## What to do if you have installed using the live media?
If you have installed using the live media you can continue [updating and upgrading FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/updating-upgrading.html), and there is no need for a migration of your installed system.  

## What to do for updated versions of the LiveCD?
If you enjoyed using the LiveCD please see projects which succeed it such as [HelloSystem](https://github.com/helloSystem/ISO), [LIVEStep](https://github.com/probonopd/LIVEstep), and of course [GhostBSD](http://www.ghostbsd.org) which offers a full community expereince.  

## What to do if you are a developer?
If you are a developer interesting in building, maintaining your own community solution the source code will always remain available on [GitHub](https://github.com/furybsd/furybsd-livecd).
