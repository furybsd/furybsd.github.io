Thank you for your interest in FuryBSD.  This project as an effort to build, and publish quarterly ISO images has been discontinued.  

## What to do if you have installed using the live media?

## What to do for updated versions of the LiveCD?
If you enjoyed using the LiveCD please see projects which succeed it such as [HelloSystem](https://github.com/helloSystem/ISO), [LIVEStep](https://github.com/probonopd/LIVEstep), and of course [GhostBSD](http://www.ghostbsd.org) which offers a full community driven expereince.  

## What to do if you are a developer?
If you are a developer interesting in building, maintaining your own community the source code will always remain available on [GitHub](https://github.com/furybsd/furybsd-livecd).
